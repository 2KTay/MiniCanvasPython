# MiniCanvasPython

It is written in Python.
It is mini version of Canvas, with data stored in csv files, e.g. use one file to store
usernames and passwords, one file to store courses taken by a user etc. You will implement an admin
module and a student module. When the admin module runs, the user will login and be able to add
students and the courses they take. The information will be saved into csv files. When the student
module runs, the user will login and be able to see the courses they take (based on data entered by the
admin and stored in csv files). Whenever an admin enters more information in future runs, it will
append to the existing csv files.
